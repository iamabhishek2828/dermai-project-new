My React App
Welcome to My React App! This project is built using Create React App, a comfortable environment to develop React applications with minimal configuration.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these instructions:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can verify this by running:

bash
Copy code
node -v
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the Create React App testing documentation for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the deployment section for more details.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project for full control. Use this command only if you need to customize the build setup.
